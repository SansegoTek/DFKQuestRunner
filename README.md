If you are absolutely sure you want to go ahead and use DFKQuestRunner, keep reading! 


# Installation
Mac/windows/linux sections
Install node etc
Download code
npm install


# Configuration
PK needs to be stored in a text file
File should ideally be stored on USB, especially secure USB like IronKeye
config.json

Each config section has a "professionHeroes" and a "nonProfessionHeroes" field. You should add your heroes with the relevant profession to "professionHeroes", and any others (e.g. miners or gardeners) that you would still like to use for fishing/foraging to "nonProfessionHeroes"

useBackupRPC is currently set to true as there are ongoing issues with Harmony RPC

May need to hard-refresh DFK in browser before seeing updated staminas/inventory - Ctrl-F5
Should be safe to leave running, while aslo doing quests in web app, but NOT TESTED!
